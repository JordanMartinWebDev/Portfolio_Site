Project: Clark's Cakes Website
Description: A website created for Clark Robertson for his cake/bakery shop. This site is designed to show portfolios, 
             give users an easy way to see availability, and a method of contact. This site is purely HTML, CSS (with Sass), 
             and JavaScript. These technologies will make the site light weight, hopefully reducing the load times for the picture
             portfolios. This project also will use the Lightbox Library on the portfolio pages to make an easy image gallery.
             
Site Status: In Progress

Project Installation Recommendation: To look at the project code more effectively, I recommend using Visual Studio Code and 
                                     installing the Live Server Extension to view the project locally.
                                     To install for hosting purposes, download everything inside the 'dist' folder. Place those
                                     contents in your server host of choice (Netlify, Inmotion, etc.) then the site will launch.
                                     To configure the Contact Page, I recommend researching your hosting site's method. 
                                     
                                     For instance,
                                     Netlify has HTML tags you can place in your form to easily get your contact page working.
                                     Inmotion does not have a system for this built in. So, there is a provided PHP file(In progress)
                                        that will get the contact page working. NOTE: Still reference Inmotion documentation for detail
